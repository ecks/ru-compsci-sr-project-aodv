#summary What to do with these files.

You need to write over the current files in OPNET. In order to do that, get Tortoise SVN and create a directory named *SVN* under C:\ then right-click on that folder and click *create repository here* under the Tortoise SVN menu. Then if you click inside, there should be some files. Then right-click anywhere and choose *svn checkout*, and for the URL of repository type in _http://ru-compsci-sr-project-aodv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/_ with the checkout dir being _C:\SVN\ru-compsci-sr-project-aodv_. It prompts you for your password, which you can find under http://code.google.com/hosting/settings. After you type in your username and password (the one generated by google), you will get a directory structure of the files. Simply overwrite these files for their OPNET equivalents in the actual directory that you will use. Alternatively you can create a link to the file in the repository, provided you never delete it.

So far the files like this:

C:\SVN\ru-compsci-sr-project-aodv\OPNET\14.5.A\models\std\manet\aodv_pkt_support.ex.c --> C:\Program Files\OPNET\14.5.A\models\std\manet\aodv_pkt_support.ex.c

C:\SVN\ru-compsci-sr-project-aodv\OPNET\14.5.A\models\std\include\aodv_pkt_support.h --> C:\Program Files\OPNET\14.5.A\models\std\include\aodv_pkt_support.h

C:\SVN\ru-compsci-sr-project-aodv\OPNET\14.5.A\models\std\include\aodv_ptypes.h --> C:\Program Files\OPNET\14.5.A\models\std\include\aodv_ptypes.h

You will need to treat the function blocks inside the process model specially. There are two options, to remove the temporary aodv_rte.pr.c and replace your copy in the manet directory, or you can import the *aodv_rte.function block* from the editor in OPNET. You will first need to *Select All* and backspace to delete the text, since it just appends to the end, and doesn't actually replace the text.
